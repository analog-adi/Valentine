                        Dear Soumya ,<br><br>
                    I am in love with you<br><br>
                    I am in love with you. Nothing is ever going to change that. You are the most important thing in my life. I love
                    everything about you from the way you smile and giggle when I do something stupid, to listening to you talk about the
                    weather. I want you to feel special. That is one of the ways that I can truly repay you for being the greatest person in
                    my life. I couldn't stop thinking about you all day. In the morning I woke up thinking about you. As I was eating
                    breakfast, I was thinking about you. It makes me realize how close we are, and how great things will be when we can be
                    together. I do my best to try and keep you happy about us being apart for these weeks. And it's hard. I really hate
                    being away from you. It takes a lot of concentration for me to try and actually be with other people instead of thinking
                    about you. It's really crazy for me. I never knew what it was really like to be in love, and I never knew you could love
                    someone as much as this. It's hard trying to be optimistic about things when we've been apart so much for so long. I
                    want to be with you forever, and don't want to have to go through this again. But I know that we will, and it's painful
                    to think about. I feel like us being apart for so long has brought us closer together.
    <br>
                    It's made us realize how much we need each other.! always want to be by your side, and it's difficult to be me without
                    you. I love you more than I ever dreamed¬†possible.   <br>
